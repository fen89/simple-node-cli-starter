[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/fen89/simple-node-cli-starter.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Ready for creating interactive node command line interfaces, including a few tools to get started right away:

- [Colors](https://github.com/marak/colors.js/) for colorizing the node console output
- [Figlet](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js) for implementing FIGfont spec in js
- [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) for commit message format
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to enforce commit format using git hooks
- [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automatic publish and release new versions and generating a changelog
- [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/) for updating project dependencies automatically

## Commitizen

Commitizen needs to be installed globally to work. Please install it using `npm install commitizen -g` or `yarn add global commitizen`.
